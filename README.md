# Download-High-resolution-Satellite-Imagery
This script reads KML files, extracts bounding boxes, and downloads high-resolution satellite imagery as GeoTIFFs using the samgeo library. It automates image extraction for defined regions, making it useful for geospatial analysis and remote sensing tasks.It downloads the tiles from Tile Map Server.

Itâ€™s resource intensive, so I prefer running it on platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle for better performance and free compute resources.
